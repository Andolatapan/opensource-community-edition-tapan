 * time and showed its entities in the task list. This decodes the quote,
 * apostrophe and ampersand entities in easycases.title back to the characters
 * they stand for, repeating until stable so "&amp;quot;" also comes back as '"'.
 *
 * &lt; and &gt; are left alone: turning them into real angle brackets would only
 * be safe if every place a title is printed escaped it, and that is not worth
 * betting on for a cosmetic fix.
